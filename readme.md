This notebook contains high level information on the bioinformatics pipeline that was used for the analysis reported in Szydzik J et al. ATR inhibition enables complete tumour regression in ALK-driven NB mouse models, Nature Communications 2021

# Environment
  
Analysis was performed in a Conda environment. See **ATR.yml** for details. **scripts/Rpacks** describes R packages that were installed independently.

# Experimental conditions
